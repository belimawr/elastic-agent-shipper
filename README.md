# elastic-agent-shipper
Data shipper for the Elastic Agent - single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host.


## Starting the shipper locally
Be aware that this is a very ugly hack!

To start the shipper:
```
go run .
```

It will start with log leve debug for all loggers.
